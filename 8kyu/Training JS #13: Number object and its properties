//Task:

Coding in function whatNumberIsIt. function accept 1 parameter:n. it's a number.

To judge the number n. If n is one of the above five constants, return one of these string:

"Input number is Number.MAX_VALUE"
"Input number is Number.MIN_VALUE"
"Input number is Number.NaN"
"Input number is Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY"
"Input number is Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY"
Other values should return "Input number is xxx". xxx means this number.

For example:

whatNumberIsIt(1/0) should return "Input number is Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY"
whatNumberIsIt(100) should return "Input number is 100"
What you need to think about is how to judge it correctly and effectively and don't forget isNaN().

//Solution:

                    function whatNumberIsIt(n){
                      let answer = '';
                      if (isNaN(n) === true) return answer = 'Input number is Number.NaN';
                      if (n == 1 / 0) return answer = 'Input number is Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY';
                      if (n == -1 / 0) return answer = 'Input number is Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY';
                      if (n == Number.MAX_VALUE) return answer = 'Input number is Number.MAX_VALUE';
                      if (n == Number.MIN_VALUE) return answer = 'Input number is Number.MIN_VALUE';
                      else return answer = 'Input number is ' + n;
                    }
