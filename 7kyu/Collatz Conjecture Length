//Task:

The Collatz Conjecture states that for any positive natural number n, this process:

if n is even, divide it by 2
if n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1
repeat
will eventually reach n = 1.

For example, if n = 20, the resulting sequence will be:

[ 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 ]
Write a program that will output the length of the Collatz Conjecture for any given n.
In the example above, the output would be 8.

//Solution:

function collatz(n) {
  let arr = [n];
  for (let i = 0; n !== 1; i++) {
  if (n % 2) {
     arr.push(n * 3 + 1);
     n = n * 3 + 1;
  } else {
    arr.push(n / 2);
    n /= 2;
  }
  }  
  return arr.length;
}
console.log(collatz(3));
