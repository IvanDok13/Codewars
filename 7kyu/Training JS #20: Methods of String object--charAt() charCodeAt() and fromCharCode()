// Task:

Coding in function topSecret, function accept 1 parameter:file. file is an encrypted string.

Encryption using the right shift 3. Your job is to decrypt the file and read the contents of the file, 
and then answer my three questions. If the answer is correct, you will pass the test. Note: the decryption 
should be left shift; Shift is only for uppercase and lowercase letters, other characters will remain the same; 
The shift mode is a cyclic shift, for example:

character "A" after decryption should be "X" instead of ">"
character "B" after decryption should be "Y" instead of "?"
character "C" after decryption should be "Z" instead of "@"
character "a" after decryption should be "x" instead of "^"
character "b" after decryption should be "y" instead of "_"
character "c" after decryption should be "z" instead of "`"
Additional hints: Fixed testcase only test the correctness of the decryption code. The answer to the three question 
will appear only after clicking on "Submit".

This task may be more difficult for beginners. Good Luck!                                 
 // Solution:
 
                                  function topSecret(str) {
                                    let char = str.split(''), res = [];
                                    for (let i = 0; i < char.length; i++) {
                                      if (char[i].charCodeAt() < 65 || char[i].charCodeAt() > 122) continue;
                                      if (char[i].charCodeAt() == 'a'.charCodeAt()) char[i] = String.fromCharCode(123);
                                      if (char[i].charCodeAt() == 'A'.charCodeAt()) char[i] = String.fromCharCode(91);
                                      if (char[i].charCodeAt() == 'b'.charCodeAt()) char[i] = String.fromCharCode(124);
                                      if (char[i].charCodeAt() == 'B'.charCodeAt()) char[i] = String.fromCharCode(89);
                                      if (char[i].charCodeAt() == 'c'.charCodeAt()) char[i] = String.fromCharCode(125);
                                      if (char[i].charCodeAt() == 'C'.charCodeAt()) char[i] = String.fromCharCode(90);
                                      char[i] = String.fromCharCode(char[i].charCodeAt() - 3);
                                    }
                                    return char.join('');
                                  }
